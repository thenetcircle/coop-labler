# TODO

* should be able to draw multiple rectagles (labels) per image,
* each rectangle drawn should be shown in a 'label list' in the UI where the user can remove a rectangle if needed,
* the 'label list' only shows rectangles for the current image,
* only submit when changing image, IF any rectangles were added/removed,
* when changing image, redraw all existing rectangles for that image and show them in the 'label list',
* get username/id from AD (e.g. the email address), to be used when submitting labels to the backend,
* a separate tab/pane where all images for a project is listed (thumbnails), separated into 'images with labels' and 'images without labels'.
